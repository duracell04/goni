# GOVERNANCE

Decision flow:
- Specs: changes require an RFC in blueprint/docs/rfcs/ and a review.
- Prototype code: PRs with tests or a clear rationale if tests are not feasible.
- Security/policy changes: follow SECURITY.md for disclosure and review.

Current maintainership:
- Until a maintainer list exists, decisions follow PR review by the repo owner.

Conflicts:
- Resolve in PR discussion; if unresolved, open an RFC and record the decision.
