# Contributing

We are laser-focused on gut-punch A: perfect, instant, offline memory of your own files.

Fastest path to merge:
- If your PR makes the demo faster, more accurate, or more memory-efficient, it’s in-scope.
- Keep `README.md` and `docs/goni-story.md` / `docs/goni-whitepaper.md` free of concrete specs; put numbers in `hardware/90-decisions.md`, `software/90-decisions.md`, or `prototype/**` (with dates, seeds, and **valid until**).
- Tightening constraints? Update `hardware/10-requirements.md` or `software/90-decisions.md` with evidence (photo, measurement, benchmark) and a **valid until** line.

Before opening a PR, skim `docs/goni-agility-rules.md` and complete the PR checklist in `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
