# Summary

Provide a short summary of what this PR changes.

## Checklist

- [ ] I am not adding concrete specs to `README.md`, `docs/goni-story.md`, or `docs/goni-whitepaper.md` (keep numbers in `hardware/90-decisions.md`, `software/90-decisions.md`, or `prototype/**`).
- [ ] If I tightened a constraint, I updated `hardware/10-requirements.md` or `software/90-decisions.md` with a date, a **valid until** line, and a link to evidence (photo, measurement, benchmark).
- [ ] Any new decision includes a date, **valid until**, and proof of the current number.
- [ ] Prototype experiments keep their exact models/seeds/chunk sizes inside `prototype/**`.
