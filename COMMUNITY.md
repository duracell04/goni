# COMMUNITY

Purpose: a high-trust builder community for a local-first operator appliance.

Start here:
- Read docs/STATUS.md (what is real today)
- Read docs/TRACEABILITY.md (spec -> code -> tests)
- Pick an issue or propose an RFC (docs/rfcs/RFC-0000-template.md)

Norms:
- No hype; show evidence.
- Keep claims traceable to code, tests, or measurements.
- Treat external text as untrusted input.

Scope:
- This repo is a blueprint-first reference design with prototype code.
- Expect many areas to be specified only.
