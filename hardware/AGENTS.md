# AGENTS.md (hardware) - Overrides

## Overrides
- Hardware decisions MUST be recorded in `hardware/90-decisions.md`.
- Any numeric hardware claim MUST include: date, "last validated", and an evidence link (benchmark/log/photo).
- Avoid changing reference build assumptions without an ADR update.

## Evidence discipline
- Avoid hard performance numbers unless paired with a dated measurement artefact (test conditions + what was measured).
