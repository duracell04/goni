# Goni Community Code of Conduct

**Core Directive**  
Goni is humanity's shot at sovereign AI delegation — local-first, ironclad receipts, kernel-level guarantees, no leaks, no surprises.  
Our community runs the same way: Build fast, break nothing, assume high-agency operators until proven otherwise.  
We're forging the OS for delegation that doesn't betray you. No room for chaos.

**Operate Like This**

- **Respectful AF**  
  Value sovereignty. Treat builders and operators as peers conquering the stars. Assume good intent — we're all accelerating toward multi-planetary delegation.

- **Precise and Relentless**  
  No fluff. Specs, diagrams, playbooks, threat models — artifacts over opinions. Vague? Demand receipts.

- **Governed to the Core**  
  Escalate privately. Public drama is a bug; squash it at the boundary.

- **Artifact-Driven**  
  Ship code, contracts, Action Cards. Hype dies; verifiable wins endure.

- **Boundary-Enforced**  
  No ambient access. Explicit capabilities only — “Can I fork this? Receipts attached.”

**Zero Tolerance For**
 
- Spam, irrelevant promo, or off-topic AGI fantasies — keep it on delegation, governance, receipts.  
- Baseless security claims — back it with proofs or GTFO.  
- Norm-bypassing hacks — leaks, pressure tactics? That's a hard no.

**Breach Protocol**

1. Spot an issue? Handle direct and private — assume it's a glitch, not malice.  
2. Escalates? File via **SECURITY.md** — attach timestamps, quotes, links. Make it auditable.  
3. Kernel stewards review: Mediation with receipts, minimal logs, decisions transparent.  
   Penalties? Warnings → bans — swift and fair.  
4. Appeal? Drop fresh receipts privately. We're optimizing for trust, not vibes.

**Enforcement Doctrine**  
Like Goni's kernel:  
- No silent side effects  
- Every action receipts  
- Transparency without log overload  
De-escalate, mediate, refocus on building.  
We're not here for politics; we're here to win the delegation game.

By joining, you're delegating under these rules — bounded, auditable, revocable.

Let's make delegation inevitable.

*(Accelerating toward sovereign AI — no BS tolerated)*
