# BOM Experiments

This folder contains BOM snapshots and notes used to sanity-check feasibility and costs.

Guidelines:

- **Do not overwrite old BOMs**: create a new file (v2, v3, …) with a snapshot date.
- Anchor at least the **compute module price** to a public listing on the snapshot date.
- Everything else can be a range until we have manufacturing quotes.
- Keep BOMs consistent with current decisions in [`../90-decisions.md`](/blueprint/hardware/90-decisions.md).

Current files:

- `bom-v1-apu-node.md` — older exploratory draft (cleaned up for formatting).
- `bom-v2-framework-395-128gb.md` — current MVP reference snapshot (2025-12-14).
