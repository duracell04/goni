# Deprecated – canonical schemas moved

The normative data ontology now lives in:
- `blueprint/software/50-data/00-index.md` (map)
- `blueprint/software/50-data/51-schemas-mvp.md` (human-readable schemas)
- `blueprint/software/50-data/53-schema-dsl-and-macros.md` (authoritative DSL block)
- Executable implementation: `goni-prototype-lab:software/kernel/goni-schema` (`define_tables!`).

This file remains only as a stub for legacy links. Refer to the above paths for the source of truth.
