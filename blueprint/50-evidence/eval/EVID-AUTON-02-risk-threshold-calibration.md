# EVID-AUTON-02 Risk Threshold Calibration

Goal: calibrate risk scoring and threshold policies so "auto unless risky"
improves throughput without unsafe autonomous side effects.

## Core checks
- risk score calibration on labelled traces
- escalation precision/recall for high-risk actions
- unsafe autonomy incident rate under production-like policies
- rollback/compensation success for autonomous mistakes

## Artifact links
- TBD
