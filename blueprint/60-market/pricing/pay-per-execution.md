# Pay Per Execution (Packaging Note)

Status: Specified only / roadmap
Last updated: 2026-02-20

Execution-metered packaging can work as a secondary model, not as the core
trust promise.

## Where it can fit

- metered council escalations,
- metered premium verification checks,
- metered enterprise audit exports at large scale.

## Risks

- can incentivize unsafe over-automation if tied only to volume,
- may conflict with local-first expectations if overused,
- shifts attention toward throughput instead of governance quality.

## Recommended posture for Goni

- treat execution metering as an optional add-on,
- keep the primary value on safety, policy assurance, and managed reliability,
- ensure metered paths still emit full receipts and policy outcomes.
