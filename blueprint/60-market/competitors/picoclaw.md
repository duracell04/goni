# PicoClaw - Competitor Snapshot (Ultra-Light Agent Gateway)

Last updated: 2026-02-16 (notes-based, verify sources)

Category: local-first personal assistant + gateway + skills ecosystem.

## What it is / target user
- Open-source assistant positioned for very low-end hardware.
- Targets tinkerers and operators who value tiny footprint and simple deployment.

## Deployment model
- Self-contained binary posture, multi-architecture focus.
- Can be run as local agent and/or gateway entry point.

## Trust model
- Fast onboarding and integrations are a strength.
- Policy/receipt guarantees are not the primary product claim.

## Extension ecosystem risk
- Skills/extensions increase supply-chain and permission-scope risk.
- Channel integrations expand sender, identity, and phishing boundaries.

## Differentiation vs Goni
- PicoClaw pressure: footprint, speed, distribution.
- Goni response: governance depth (capabilities, mediation, receipts, QoS).

## Steal these ideas
- Tiny deploy targets and first-run simplicity.
- Clear hardware affordability messaging.

## Avoid these traps
- Unscoped skills with weak verification.
- Channel adapters without strong sender allowlists and policy boundaries.
