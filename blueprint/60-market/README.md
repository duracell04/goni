# Market Lane

Competitors, suppliers, partners, and other ecosystem players.

Technology-first rules for this lane:
- Track architecture, security model, integration model, and operating constraints.
- Track product surfaces and governance patterns (for example: extension model, permissions, auditability).
- Use dated snapshots and cite primary sources.
- Do not include concrete prices, pricing plans, or revenue assumptions.
- Keep this lane descriptive and comparative, not normative.

Not here: normative specs or evidence.

Includes:
- competitors and supplier snapshots,
- ecosystem partner mapping,
- pricing model patterns without concrete price assumptions.
