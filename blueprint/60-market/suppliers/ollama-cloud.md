# Ollama Cloud - Supplier Snapshot (GLM-5 Cloud Option)

Last updated: 2026-02-16 (notes-based, verify source data)

Category: cloud model gateway option.

## What it is
- Ollama-hosted cloud model option for large context/agentic workloads.
- Relevant to Goni as a possible council seat, not a direct product competitor.

## Why it matters for Goni
- Demonstrates availability of large cloud seats for escalation paths.
- Reinforces need for strict redaction, budgets, and receipts on remote calls.

## Integration posture
- Treat as pluggable supplier behind council policy.
- Never bypass network gate or capability policy when routing remotely.

## Risks
- Provider lock-in if abstraction leaks into product logic.
- Resource unpredictability without hard metering and budget controls.
