# RECEIPTS

Status: Implemented (untested)

Receipts are immutable, append-only records of mediated actions.
Default policy is minimal disclosure: hashes and metadata only.

See blueprint/docs/specs/receipts.md for the normative schema and semantics.

See blueprint/docs/receipts/00-index.md for the receipts hub and cross-links.
