# Goni Whitepaper

Human-readable description of the Goni concept.

## Related work & inspiration

Goni does not exist in a vacuum. It is heavily informed by:

- **Existing systems and research** on home AI clusters, distributed inference, and local LLM infrastructure.
- **Builders and thinkers** who are pushing the “OwnYourAI”, sovereign infra, and practical agent workflows forward.

For a structured overview, see:

- [`related-projects.md`](./related-projects.md)  
  Survey of systems like EXO, MultiCortex EXO, Cake, prima.cpp, Beowulf AI Cluster, and llama.cpp – i.e. the technical prior art around home clusters and distributed inference.

- [`inspiration.md`](./inspiration.md)  
  A “people map” of OwnYourAI / sovereign-infra builders and agent/content-automation builders whose work shapes Goni’s hardware, software, and narrative.

Both documents are maintained as **living references** and should be consulted when:

- evaluating new architectural ideas (to avoid reinventing solved problems), or  
- framing Goni for different audiences (engineers, infra people, founders, regulated-sector clients).
