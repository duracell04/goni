# References (evidence anchors)

Purpose: keep a small, stable list of evidence keys that specs can cite
without repeating full citations or long summaries.

Conventions:
- Use stable keys like `[[liu2023-lost-middle]]`.
- Each key maps to a short, annotated entry in `bibliography.md`.
- Specs cite keys inline or as footnotes.
- Do not add citations to vision docs (`README.md`, `docs/goni-story.md`,
  `docs/goni-whitepaper.md`).

Additions:
1) Add a new key to `bibliography.md`.
2) Reference it from the relevant spec section.

See `bibliography.md` for the current list.
