# AGENTS.md (software) - Overrides

## Overrides
- Prefer updating canonical contracts under `software/50-data/*` before changing implementation.
- Any change that affects data schemas, plane tags, or text confinement MUST update:
  - `software/50-data/51-schemas-mvp.md` (contract)
  - `software/50-data/53-schema-dsl-and-macros.md` (mechanism)
  - and the relevant kernel tests under `software/kernel/goni-schema/tests/`

## Dependency hygiene
- Minimise new dependencies. If adding a dependency, document:
  - why it is needed
  - which crate owns it
  - what contract/invariant it supports
