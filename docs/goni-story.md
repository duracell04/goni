# Goni Story – Narrative for Tech Enthusiasts

> Target audience: technically literate people who want a life upgrade, not another side project to maintain (founders, engineers, indie hackers).  
> Use this text for: website “About” page, launch blog post, landing page copy, or onboarding material for early testers.

## One-sentence

Goni is a matte-black local AI node that lets you own fast, private assistants without running a data center or a GPU farm.

## Day in the life

- Morning: summarize inbox, calendar shifts, and files without shipping data to a third party.  
- Afternoon: pair-program, refactor, and draft docs on-device with 30-40B models.  
- Night: queue batch jobs (embeddings, research) that spill to the mesh only when worth it.

## Why local-first

- Predictable latency and privacy for day-to-day workflows.  
- You keep the checkpoints, adapters, and prompts that shape your work.  
- Cloud is used intentionally (long-context, giant models), not as a default.

## Reuse

- Website: copy/paste sections into marketing pages.  
- Pitch decks: lift the “one-sentence” and “day in the life” parts.  
- Docs: link from `/README.md` and `/docs/goni-whitepaper.md`.
